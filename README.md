# Brain Tumor Segmentation using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project implements an advanced brain tumor segmentation system using deep learning approaches, specifically leveraging DenseNet and ResNet architectures. The system is designed to automatically identify and segment brain tumors from MRI scans, providing a valuable tool for medical imaging analysis.

## Features
- Implementation of DenseNet and ResNet architectures for tumor segmentation
- Processing and analysis of medical MRI images
- Automated tumor region identification and segmentation
- Deep learning-based approach for accurate results

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- nibabel (for medical image processing)
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- jupyter notebook

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain_tumor_segmentation.git
cd brain_tumor_segmentation
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install torch numpy opencv-python nibabel scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
```

## Usage
1. Open the `densenet-resnet.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook densenet-resnet.ipynb
```

2. Follow the notebook instructions for:
   - Data preprocessing
   - Model training
   - Tumor segmentation
   - Results visualization

## Model Architecture
The project combines the strengths of both DenseNet and ResNet architectures:
- DenseNet: Ensures maximum information flow between layers
- ResNet: Helps in training deeper networks effectively
- Combined approach for optimal segmentation results

## Dataset
The model is designed to work with standard medical imaging datasets. Please ensure your MRI data is in a compatible format (e.g., NIFTI, DICOM).

## Results
The segmentation results can be visualized directly in the notebook, showing:
- Original MRI scans
- Segmented tumor regions
- Overlay visualizations
- Performance metrics
